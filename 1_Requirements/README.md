## Introduction
In most universities, there are well-equipped libraries with excellent infrastructure facilities having a large collection of books. Compared to public libraries, university libraries have a large collection on science and engineering where readers get scope for gathering vast knowledge on respective fields. Because of the dispersion of knowledge, this collection increases rapidly day by day. Although there are many existing software tools, most of those are not proper user interactive and have some limitations for accessing the books. Besides, most universities in mid-level countries like Bangladesh still are using traditional way to manage their library, which prevents faster searching for a book, and faster report generation. This leads to develop an online digital library management system. A good interactive interface was available and users could obtain a fresh and different feeling. Proper security has been maintained in the proposed system because only authorized users could access this application.

## Research
From ancient times the knowledge is spread by people across the world in written form. First, the information is stored by carving words on copper using the sharp tool; by the time the papers are invented and using the ink and feather of bird the information is started to store on paper, which helped a lot for storing purpose. It's very difficult to store the data stored in books secured and safe; as we know the paper can be torn apart or they got stolen by someone or in worst scenario pages get eaten by bugs. So as we know from old times the libraries are managed manually by a group of people. The methods are really difficult as compare to todayâ€™s digitized world, nowadays we can find anything on just one click, but we see at past methods they kept written records for each thing and that record goes on increasing as time pass. If the records got lost then there is no other for retrieving them back, so the loss is permanent. 

## Benefits
Digitization of library helps to keep all the records secured and retrievable which saves the paperwork and made library records easy to store.
